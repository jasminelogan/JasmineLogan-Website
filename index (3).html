        <div class="subheading mb-5">Musicüéµ</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Since I graduated from high school at sixteen and decided to attend university, I chose to study music because it was something that I knew I wanted since my freshman year of high school. I knew I wanted to commit to music and that with drive and determination, I would achieve my goals. Producing and releasing my first single ‚ÄúWith You‚Äù my senior year in collaboration with upcoming artist Nueve Lio, I debuted with a single that helped build a network and audience of my own. Through my journey in music production, song-writing, composing and experience in the studio I knew that there were further opportunities to study and perfect my craft. As I researched careers in the music industry I gained interest in entertainment law and found the perfect opportunity at UCR. After researching UCR‚Äôs various clubs, the EARS (Music student group) and its studio, songwriting, and production workshops, I knew that there were opportunities for me to gain experience. <br><br>
      
        Further, after inquiring with the music department I realized that with such an intimate music program I would have great quality studies. Especially with classes specializing in arts, management, digital audio and sound, I knew such classes at UCR would benefit my career and passion. With entertainment law as my career goal, my desire to study music and law influenced my decision to major in music with a concentration in industry and minor in pre-law. Not only do I want to pursue a career in management and production but I further strive to create my own record label. I would represent a collective of artists who push past art and represent communities, identities, and niche life-styles. As an artist, I understand that the importance of quality and the need for quality both interfere in the industry lifestyle. Burnout and creative drought cause the most passionate artist to quit.<br><br>
        
        Being a self-taught producer in addition to my experiences in bands, choir, and even musical theater, I have first-hand experience in various aspects of the arts. From mixing my own vocals on digital audio workstations, to perfecting them in classical training lessons, I understand the work and dedication it takes to uphold quality. Making a new song every week but it never being up to my standards constantly drained me and made me realize that my work ethic was not sustainable nor was it true to me. My love for music surpasses just a career, to me it tells stories, emotions, people, and speaks of past, present, and future all at once. It is anything you want it to be and it is valued by people in so many ways that are personal and intimate. It is an art, not a job, and my label would address this issue and spread a more intuitive, genuine, and competitive lifestyle amongst the music community. In contrast to the lack of meaning in current ‚Äúsurface-level‚Äù industry music; I will create a platform and community of passionate artists to start a new generation of complex and crafted music.
